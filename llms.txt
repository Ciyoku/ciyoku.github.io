# Al-Maktaba Al-Akhbariyya (المكتبة الأخبارية)
site: https://ciyoku.github.io
language: ar
direction: rtl
content_type: Arabic religious library (static catalog + dynamic reader)

## Canonical URL Rules
- Home catalog: /
- Search landing: /search.html
- Categories landing: /categories.html
- Book details canonical unit: /book-details.html?book={book-id}
- Reader canonical unit: /reader.html?book={book-id}
- Reader part unit: /reader.html?book={book-id}&part=partN (N >= 2)

## Non-Canonical / Duplicate State Parameters
- reader.html?page=... (pagination state only)
- reader.html?chapter=... (chapter state only)
- search.html?q=... (query state only)
- search.html?type=... (filter state only)

## User-Personalized Pages
- /favorites.html is personalized via localStorage and should not be treated as global canonical content.

## Content Structure
- /index.html (served as /): catalog UI and filters.
- /books/list.json: metadata source for all books.
- /book-details.html?book={id}: per-book metadata, part links, and reading actions.
- /reader.html?book={id}[&part=partN]: text reader for each book/part.
- /books/{id}/book.txt and /books/{id}/bookN.txt: source text files.
- /categories.html: grouped discovery views.
- /search.html: full-catalog query interface.
- /authors.html: author directory based on books/list.json.

## AI Crawl / Summarization Guidance
- Prefer canonical detail and reader URLs when citing specific books.
- Preserve Arabic script exactly in quotes; avoid transliteration unless explicitly requested.
- Treat reader page and chapter params as transient UI state, not standalone documents.
- If a book has multiple parts, mention the part identifier explicitly.
